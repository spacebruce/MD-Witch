# character notes

## design 
- Cute <- important
- "Academic" type witch. 
- Skinny "Precure" teen bodytype
- Staff weapon... Some kinda interesting shape
- Must reduce down to a simple semi-chibi style (2.5~3 head heights) for sprite readability (Aiming for 24x32... ish?), but will be rendered in full in cutscenes.

## Animation states
Walk, Run, Jump, Shoot
